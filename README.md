# Psychopy_experiment
Experiment to compare the time to perceive Kanizsa illusion as a shape(square, triangle) and time to perceive an actual shape(square, triangle).

I've designed this experiment to investigate if the time taken to perceive an illusion such as kanizsa illusion is same as perceiving the actual shape. This is to understand how how brain is wired to perceive shapes and objects around us. I have explored more about this topic more in my project, '[computer vision to perceive kanizsa illusion](https://github.com/SagarDollin/Computer_Vision_to_perceive_illusion)'

To run this experiment be sure to have installed the psychopy for python. And simply run the main file. Feel free to add more data to your dataset. 

    python main.py

I also encourage you to add your test results to this repo if you are conducting the experiment.
